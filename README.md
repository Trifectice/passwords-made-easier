# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

This is a random password generator I made to enable my work force to safely and reliable generate new passwords and for the new passwords to be generated by their own safety standards. You can select the amount of characters, and even the type of characters. With this project I learned valuable lessons in 
* How to create vars in JS,
* How to leaverage "if" statements
* How to use "For lops"
* And how to use the DOM to pull classes and ID's from HTML into JS.

## Usage

To use press the "Generate Password" button. You will be prompted to select a range of characters and after you must chose you character types. Bellow will be screen shots of examples of the application at work. click [here](https://trifectice.github.io/passwords-made-easier/) to check the site out for yourself!
